## Implementation Details

### Technical Implementation Strategy

#### 1. Progressive Enhancement
- Start with basic functionality that works everywhere
- Add advanced features that enhance the experience
- Ensure graceful degradation for older browsers

#### 2. Modular Architecture
- Separate concerns into distinct modules
- Use ES6 modules for clean imports/exports
- Implement clear interfaces between components

#### 3. Performance First
- Implement efficient algorithms for JSON processing
- Use debouncing for real-time features
- Optimize DOM manipulations
- Handle large files efficiently

#### 4. Accessibility by Design
- Implement semantic HTML from the start
- Add ARIA labels and roles
- Ensure keyboard navigation
- Test with screen readers

### Development Workflow

#### 1. Environment Setup
- Create local development environment
- Set up live reload for efficient development
- Configure code formatting and linting
- Set up debugging tools

#### 2. Iterative Development
- Work in small, testable increments
- Test each feature before moving to the next
- Refactor as needed during development
- Maintain code quality throughout

#### 3. Testing Strategy
- Test functionality with various JSON examples
- Test error scenarios and edge cases
- Test performance with large files
- Test across different browsers and devices

### Quality Assurance

#### 1. Code Quality
- Follow JavaScript best practices
- Use consistent naming conventions
- Add comprehensive comments
- Maintain clean, readable code

#### 2. Performance Benchmarks
- Validation speed: < 100ms for 1MB JSON
- UI responsiveness: < 16ms frame time
- Memory usage: < 50MB for typical usage
- Load time: < 2 seconds on 3G

#### 3. Browser Compatibility
